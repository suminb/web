## Public Speeches

### AWS re:Invent 2017: [Automating Mother Nature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7kF7r7UBFE)

Discussed the architecture that we settled on for algorithmic generation of
game content in a large scale with a number of components provided by Amazon
Web Services such as distributed messaging queues (SQS), containerized
application clusters (ECS), and object storages (S3).

### Nexon Developers Conference 2016: [Automated Game Terrain Management for Durango](http://ndcreplay.nexon.com/NDC2016/sessions/NDC2016_0062.html)

Discussed how we built an automated pipeline to supply natural resources. Due
to the sheer size of the in-game world, the environment simulation is performed
on-demand, within a limited geographic boundary, in accordance with player
activities.

### Nexon Developers Conference 2015: [Natural Environment Simulation for Durango](http://ndcreplay.nexon.com/NDC2015/sessions/NDC2015_0063.html)

Discussed how we built an in-game environment simulator with OpenCL to handle a
massive parallel processing. The primary purpose of the simulator is to provide
natural resources based on realistic simulations by taking a number of
geographic features, such as topography, temperature, humidity, soil fertility,
into consideration.

## Patents &amp; Research Papers

### [Patent #1020160025511: A system for simulating a game environment](https://doi.org/10.8080/1020160025511) (Mar 2016)

Nexon decided to file a patent with the work referred above as *natural
environment simulation*. I was listed as a co-author along with the game
designer who pioneered the concept.

### [Human Natural Instruction of a Simulated Electronic Student](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221250935_Human_Natural_Instruction_of_a_Simulated_Electronic_Student) (Jan 2011)

Discusses how *human-instructable computing* can be achieved. That is, how an
*electronic student* can be taught using the same natural instruction methods
humans use.

three-dimensional dynamic models of stellar streams in the immediate vicinity
of the Milky Way galaxy.

### [Radioactivity](https://bitbucket.org/suminb/radioactivity) (Discontinued)

This project had started in March of 2011 in an attempt to help the general
public to be alerted regarding the spread of radiation and other radioactive
materials originated from the catastrophic incident in the Fukushima nuclear
power plant in Japan, by visualizing city-wise radition levels in near real
time.
