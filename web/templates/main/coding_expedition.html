        <p>
          <strong>Coding Expedition</strong> is an act of writing code in
          anywhere but home or office.  It generally, but not necessarily, takes
          place in remote locations far from all the distractions and pollutions 
          of a large city.
        </p>
        <p>
          I like coding and I also like going on a trip.  A drawback of having
          these as a hobby is that both activities require a non-trivial amount
          of time, which I lack the most.  My solution was to combine these
          two.  Whenever I feel like, I open the Google Maps, pick a decent
          cafe or something comparable, grab my MacBook, and drive to the
          destination, without thinking too much. The trip may be contained in
          a single day, or it may last for a couple of days.
        </p>
        <p>
          On a good day, I get a good amount of work done. A couple of features
          or so in one of my hobby projects. If not, that's not the end of the
          world.  I still get to enjoy some great local food, engage in a
          conversion with local people. It is a good way to expand my
          intellectual and cultural horizon because interaction with people
          outside my circle almost always gives me a new, fresh perspective.
