This is where most of my experience lies on as a junior software engineer. This
project provided me with a number of great opportunities to grow as a software
engineer. Building an MMORPG server entails a long list of non-trivial
challenges, especially if the server is distributed and aims to provide a
unified global server.

I have contributed a number of different parts of the system, but my major
contributions can be summurized into three projects:

1. [Ecosystem Simulator](/experiences/durango_ecosim.html)
   and an [automated pipeline](/experience/durango_ecosim_pipeline.html)
2. Terrain distribution systems
3. Marketplace
