I founded and led an unofficial research paper reading group in Nexon. I thought
it is important to maintain a certain level of academic sharpness, even though
I'm currently at a distance from the academia. Although it might be difficult to
find immediate applications of those research papers, knowing such ideas exist
makes a huge difference.

I realized it is a tremendous challenge to motivate and persuade people to do
something without having any authority over them. People get busy with their
daily lives and they easily lose interest for things they don't have to do.
However, if I could get them on the same page with the rationale (i.e., *why* we
need to read research papers) they tend to retain a certain level of activeness.

This was not only a great opportunity to learn new ideas and have thoughtful
discussions with a bunch of intelligent people, but also to cultivate some
leadership experience.

## Papers

These are some papers that my team members and myself have read:
